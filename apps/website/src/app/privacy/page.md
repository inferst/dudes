**Last Updated: May 16, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Evotars ("we," "us," or "our"), a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, collects, uses, stores, and protects personal data. Our service provides an overlay for OBS, displaying avatars and chat messages from Twitch, accessible to streamers via a Twitch OAuth login. This policy applies to all users of our service, including streamers and visitors to our website ([https://evotars.inferst.com/](https://evotars.inferst.com/)).

We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws, including:

- The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** for users in the European Union.
- The **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** for California residents.
- Other relevant regulations.

## 2. Types of Data Collected

We collect the following personal data:

- **Twitch user ID and login**, obtained through Twitch OAuth authentication.
- **Email address** is accessible via Twitch OAuth but is *not stored* in our database.
- **Non-personal data**: We use a third-party analytics service on our website’s main page to collect anonymized usage data (e.g., page views, clicks). This data does not include personal information obtained via Twitch OAuth.

## 3. Methods and Purposes of Data Collection

We collect data in the following ways:

- **Twitch OAuth**: When you log in to our admin panel using your Twitch account, we collect your user ID and login to authenticate your account and provide access to the service.
- **Analytics**: Our website uses a third-party analytics service to collect anonymized data for improving user experience and website performance.

We use the collected data for the following purposes:

- To provide and operate the core functionality of the service, including linking your Twitch account to the admin panel and enabling the OBS overlay.
- To analyze website usage (via anonymized data) to enhance our service and user experience.

## 4. Data Sharing with Third Parties

We do *not* share your personal data (Twitch user ID or login) with third parties, except as required to comply with legal obligations or Twitch’s OAuth policies.

Anonymized data collected via the third-party analytics service on our website’s main page may be processed by the analytics provider. This data does *not* include personal information obtained through Twitch OAuth.

## 5. Data Storage and Jurisdiction

Your personal data (Twitch user ID and login) is stored on our servers located in **Germany**. By using our service, you consent to the storage and processing of your data in Germany, which is subject to European Union data protection laws, including GDPR.

We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the service or comply with legal obligations. If you request deletion of your data, we will remove it from our servers, subject to any legal retention requirements.

## 6. Data Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data, including:

- **Encryption of data in transit** using HTTPS and TLS protocols to ensure secure communication between your device and our servers.

While we strive to protect your data, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure. We encourage you to use strong passwords and secure your Twitch account to further protect your information.

## 7. User Rights

As a user, you have the following rights regarding your personal data, subject to applicable laws:

- **Right to Access**: You may request information about the personal data we hold about you.

## 8. Age Restrictions

Our service is intended for users who have a Twitch account, which requires users to be at least **13 years old**, per Twitch’s policies. We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals under 13. If we become aware that a user is under 13, we will take steps to delete their data.

## 9. International Data Transfers

## 10. Compliance with Twitch Policies

Our service uses Twitch OAuth for authentication and adheres to Twitch’s **Developer Agreement** and **API Terms of Service**. We collect and process only the data specified by Twitch’s policies.

## 11. Future Data Collection

We may expand the types of data we collect in the future to improve our service’s functionality. Any such changes will be reflected in an updated Privacy Policy, and we will notify users as required by law.
