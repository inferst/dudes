**Last Updated: May 16, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Evotars** ("we," "us," or "our"), a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that provides an overlay for OBS, displaying avatars and chat messages from Twitch. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Evotars service, including our website ([https://evotars.inferst.com/](https://evotars.inferst.com/)) and any related features or services (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

The Service is operated by an individual developer and is intended for streamers who have a Twitch account. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the Service.

## 2. Eligibility

To use the Service, you must:

- Be at least **13 years old**, in accordance with Twitch’s policies.
- Have a valid Twitch account and comply with Twitch’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.
- Not be prohibited from using the Service under applicable laws.

We do not knowingly permit individuals under 13 years old to use the Service. If we become aware that a user is under 13, we may terminate their access.

## 3. Access to the Service

The Service is provided **free of charge**. You may access the Service by logging in through Twitch OAuth authentication, which allows you to use the admin panel and configure the OBS overlay.

We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time, with or without notice, including in the event of project closure. The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without any warranties of uninterrupted or error-free operation.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Service in compliance with these Terms, applicable laws, and Twitch’s policies. You must not:

- Use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose, including activities that violate laws or Twitch’s Terms of Service.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or modify the Service, except as permitted under the MIT License governing the Service’s open-source code (available at [github.com/inferst/evotars-app](https://github.com/inferst/evotars-app)).
- Use the Service to display or distribute content that is offensive, illegal, or violates Twitch’s Community Guidelines (e.g., hate speech, harassment, or explicit content).
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service, including through hacking, introducing malware, or overloading servers.

You are solely responsible for the content displayed through the OBS overlay in your streams, including ensuring it complies with Twitch’s policies and applicable laws.

## 5. Open-Source License

You may use, modify, and distribute the code in accordance with the terms of the MIT License. However, these Terms govern your use of the hosted Service, and any modifications to the code do not affect your obligations under these Terms when using the Service.

## 6. User Content

You retain ownership of any content you create or display through the Service (e.g., messages or avatars shown in the OBS overlay). However, you are solely responsible for ensuring that such content:

- Complies with Twitch’s Community Guidelines and applicable laws.

We do not claim ownership of your content but reserve the right to remove or disable access to any content displayed through the Service that violates these Terms or Twitch’s policies.

Upon termination, your right to access the Service will cease, but these Terms will continue to apply to any prior use.

## 8. No Warranties

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or uninterrupted operation.

We are not responsible for any interruptions or issues caused by third-party services, including Twitch, OBS, or other external platforms integrated with the Service.

You must comply with Twitch’s **Terms of Service**, **Community Guidelines**, and **Developer Agreement** when using the Service. We are not responsible for any actions taken by Twitch, including suspension or termination of your Twitch account, that affect your ability to use the Service.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. The updated Terms will be posted on our website with a revised **"Last Updated"** date. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
