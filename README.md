# Development

## Run the database in docker

```shell
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

> [!WARNING]
> By default, PostgreSQL runs on port `5432`. Before starting, ensure this port is not already in use on your system.

To change the PostgreSQL port, use the following command structure:
```shell
docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml run -d -p <port>:5432
```

## Run locally

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed.

1. Copy the environment variables file and update it
    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2. Install and run PostgreSQL

    You can install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) directly on your system or use Docker. For Docker instructions, refer to [Run the database in docker](<#run-the-database-in-docker>).
3. Install pnpm
    ```shell
    npm install -g pnpm
    ```
4. Install dependencies
    ```shell
    pnpm install
    ```
5. Generate the schema and run migrations
    ```shell
    pnpm run db:migrate:dev
    ```
6. Seed the database with initial data
    ```shell
    pnpm run db:seed
    ```
7. Start the server
    ```shell
    pnpm run dev
    ```
